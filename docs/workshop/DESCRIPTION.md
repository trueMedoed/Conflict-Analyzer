# Conflict Analyzer — Workshop draft (English)

Internal note: unpublished draft. Source diagnostics are implemented; the complete gameplay report is still planned. Summary and Description blocks use plain text for copying into Workshop. Update the English and Russian versions together after verification.

## Summary

Workbench helper for investigating a Conflict world. The first prototype exports partial source diagnostics; complete AI, supply, starting base and vehicle reports are still in development.

## Description

Conflict Analyzer helps scenario authors investigate the configuration of a Conflict world. It is being developed into a tool for collecting readable reports without maintaining all the tables by hand.

Current status
• A World Editor diagnostic command reads selected source entities, component fields, layers, prefab references and world positions into partial JSON.
• Tested on CTI_Campaign_HQC_Eden.ent in Arma Reforger / Workbench 1.8.0.13.
• A repository-side converter builds a partial archived report of 18 supply source bases from the diagnostic JSON, with configured income per cycle, intervals in minutes and field provenance.
• A separate source-base command now exports only the selected component and four fields. Its report builder writes Harbors.json beside the generated table; the shared data.json is a section index.
• Added a selected-base storage inspection command. On Everon airport it resolves two storage compositions and five physical containers, totaling 4000 configured supplies capacity; virtual views are excluded from the sum. The subsequent batch covers all 18 source bases; runtime grid membership remains unverified.
• Added a storage-capacity column for all 18 source bases: 49 unique physical containers, 15 resolved descendant capacities and three unknown ownership cases. Income retains its earlier verified capture; nearby detached caches are not assigned by distance.
• Added a targeted world supplies inventory and OtherContainers report: 568 additional physical slots in 129 groups, 190700 configured capacity. Previously reported base containers are excluded after identity checks; 129 other virtual views remain separate. Detached cache ownership and runtime spawning remain unverified.
• OtherContainers now groups 568 physical slots into 124 root-parent rows, retaining individual records and separate prefab instances in JSON.
• CampaignRemnantsSupplyDepot markers receive named locations within 350 m first; storage within 100 m of a marker is then reserved before later stages. Counts: 49 under depots, 35 under control points, 13 under settlements, 23 under other locations and four unrecognized; source values are preserved.
• Locations shows 45 groups: seven control points, 18 Harbors, nine depots, four settlements and seven other locations. All 170 original named labels remain in JSON.
• Locations supports manual world-group review; four objects remain in the final Unrecognized category. Location/object coordinates and distances are preserved.
• Six categories cover supply depots, control points, Harbors, settlements, other locations and unrecognized objects. Depot priority restores five storage parents / 31 containers / 7100 capacity at Regina; proximity remains distinct from source hierarchy.
• Complete gameplay reports and version comparison are not implemented yet. This is an unpublished prototype.

• Provins and its five objects are linked to Transformer Station by explicit user instruction; the rule is limited to the exact pair, scenario and game version.

• Container tables now show combined capacity / initial values before composition; source IDs and separate container counts remain in JSON.

• Harbors now uses one 18-row table: capacity and physical composition next to the name, then replenishment interval / amount and coordinates. Repeated base headings and source notes are removed; unknown values are preserved.

• Supply depots are displayed under named locations: settlements within 350 m first, then the nearest other permitted label. Seven markers are located and two remain explicitly unlocated; location names and source values are preserved; container assignments use the new depot-first priority and 100 m radius.

• Current table and heading coordinates use three decimal places, with X Y Z separated by spaces for pasting into Workbench; JSON and geographic calculations retain the original precision.

• Supply depots use the location heading without a redundant depot subheading or marker coordinates; location/object coordinates and container lists are preserved. Full marker positions remain in JSON.

• Depot marker component settings are hidden in Markdown and retained in JSON; their gameplay effect is deferred for later investigation. Physical container tables, capacity/composition and grouping are unchanged.

• Each control point presents command-post storage and other storage in one table. Command-post initial supplies are 0 after its prefab action; later campaign initialization of the base resource grid is a separate stage and has not been measured.
• Seven control points now show command-post storage capacity 1000 and both compositions: 5 × 200 or 5 × 166 + 1 × 170. Workbench verifies FIA=5 / US=6 / USSR=6 physical slots, excluding the virtual representative; composition is calculated from installed code, with the runtime grid unmeasured.

Planned features
• AI spawn points, group types, faction, group composition and soldier counts, with random options and presence probabilities shown separately.
• Supply points and storage counts, initial supplies, capacity, replenishment amount and interval.
• Starting HQ candidates, their locations, starting supplies and supply generation settings.
• Vehicle spawn points, locations, allowed vehicle options and available spawn or respawn settings.
• A readable report with data sources and warnings for incomplete information.

Current diagnostic use
1. Open the addon project in Arma Reforger Workbench.
2. Open a saved Conflict world in World Editor.
3. Run Export world source diagnostics under [ME] Conflict Analyzer / Diagnostics. The repository also documents a verified CLI route through the Workbench log.

Diagnostics read the current editor state and do not save the source world. File export uses a separate directory; direct FileIO export still needs an interactive check.

Limitations
• Reading only the .ent file is not sufficient: related layers, parent worlds, prefabs and configuration resources must be resolved.
• Configured candidates and maximum possible counts do not guarantee what will spawn in a particular game session.
• Values depend on the world and game version. Missing resources must be reported as unknown rather than zero.
• Complete object-valued configurations and faction catalogs remain unresolved; the selected-base storage command reads only its required container settings. Found components are not gameplay totals or soldier counts.
• Runtime diagnostics and an in-game interface are outside the initial proposed scope.

Research update (Unreleased): a separate HQC Everon 1.8.0.13 runtime experiment observed 0 / 1000 supplies in all seven initial FIA command-post storages. The native mission-header run yielded one sample; a direct-world run yielded three stable samples. US / USSR remain unmeasured in gameplay. This is documented research, not an implemented runtime export command.

Unreleased: supply-depot storage matching now uses 200 m; HQC Everon r0034 assigns three previously ungrouped storage parents to one depot. Other depot memberships are unchanged.

Unreleased: separate configured initial-supplies summary by control points, docks, depots, towns and other objects. Deduplicates repeated location links and explicitly retains unknown dock storage; the known subtotal is 231200 in HQC Everon r0035.

Unreleased: five supply category folders now contain category summaries and 46 individual detail pages, linked from the overall summary. Existing configured totals and grouping are preserved.

Unreleased: all 46 detail pages now expose physical supply containers and their world coordinates. Existing totals are preserved; unknown dock storage and unmeasured runtime command-post container positions remain explicit.

Unreleased: harbor pages list detached storage within 100 m and between 100 and 200 m, with links to existing groups. This is a proximity overlay; categories, totals and runtime uncertainty are preserved.

Unreleased: harbor neighbor collection is limited to 100 m. More distant neighbors are excluded; existing categories and totals are preserved.

Unreleased / r0040: inspect individual physical and virtual harbor containers, compare storage-root positions, and display observed runtime range / isolation / interaction / link checks. Categories and supply totals are unchanged.
